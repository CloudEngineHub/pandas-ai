## Custom Head

In some cases, you might want to provide custom data samples to the conversational agent to improve its understanding and responses. For example, you might want to:
- Provide better examples that represent your data patterns
- Avoid sharing sensitive information
- Guide the agent with specific data scenarios

You can do this by passing a custom head to the agent:

```python
import pandas as pd
import pandasai as pai

# Your original dataframe
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'sensitive_id': [1001, 1002, 1003, 1004, 1005],
    'amount': [150, 200, 300, 400, 500],
    'category': ['A', 'B', 'A', 'C', 'B']
})

# Create a custom head with anonymized data
head_df = pd.DataFrame({
    'sensitive_id': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    'amount': [100, 200, 300, 400, 500],
    'category': ['A', 'B', 'C', 'A', 'B']
})

# Use the custom head
smart_df = pai.SmartDataframe(df, config={
    "custom_head": head_df
})
```

The agent will use your custom head instead of the default first 5 rows of the dataframe when analyzing and responding to queries.
