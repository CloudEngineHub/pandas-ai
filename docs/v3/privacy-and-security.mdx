PandaAI provides robust privacy and security features to protect your data and ensure compliance with security requirements.

## Security

The `security` parameter allows for three levels depending on specific use cases: `none`, `standard`, and `advanced.`
This parameter is especially useful when you want to detect malicious intent from user queries and avoid executing code when such intent is found. 
By default, the `security` is set to `standard.` 
The security check might introduce stricter rules that could flag benign queries as potentially harmful. 
You can deactivate them in the configuration by setting `security` to `none.`

```python
import pandasai as pai

pai.config.set({
    "security": "none"
})
```

## Enforce Privacy

PandaAI allows you to control how much data is shared with the LLM during analysis. By default, PandaAI sends 5 anonymized samples to improve the accuracy of results. However, you can enforce stricter privacy by configuring the privacy settings:

```python
import pandasai as pai

pai.config.set({
    "enforce_privacy": True
})
```

When `enforce_privacy` is set to `True`:
- Only metadata about your data will be sent to the LLM
- No actual data samples will be shared
- The LLM will rely solely on column names and data types for analysis

This is particularly useful when working with sensitive or confidential data where data privacy is crucial.

## Custom whitelisted dependencies
By default, PandasAI only allows to run code that uses some whitelisted modules. 
This is to prevent malicious code from being executed on the server or locally. 
However, it is possible to add custom modules to the whitelist. 

```python
import pandasai as pai

pai.config.set("custom_whitelisted_dependencies": ["seaborn"])
```

The `custom_whitelisted_dependencies` parameter accepts a list of strings, where each string is the name of a module. The module must be installed in the environment where PandasAI is running.
Please, make sure you have installed the module in the environment where PandasAI is running. Otherwise, you will get an error when trying to run the code.
