Once you have turned raw data into semantic enhanced dataframes with the [semantic layer](/v3/semantic-layer), you can load them locally as either materialized or virtualized dataframes. 
Using the `.chat` method, you can ask questions and get responses and charts. 
Both materialized and virtualized dataframes can be [shared with your team](/v3/share-dataframes) by pushing them to our [data platform](/v3/ai-dashboards).

## Materialized Dataframes

Materialized dataframes load the entire dataset into memory, providing:
- Fast access to all data
- Full in-memory operations
- Ideal for small to medium datasets

```python
from pandasai import load

# Load as materialized dataframe (default)
df = load("organization/dataset-name")
```

## Virtualized Dataframes

Virtualized dataframes are ideal for large datasets as they:
- Minimize memory usage
- Load data on-demand rather than all at once
- Support the same operations as materialized dataframes

```python
from pandasai import load

# Load as virtualized dataframe
df = load("organization/dataset-name", virtualized=True)
