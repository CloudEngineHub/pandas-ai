Once you have turned raw data into dataframes using the [semantic layer](/semantic-layer), you can push them to our data platform with one line of code.
In a similar way, you can pull dataframes your team-mates have pushed to the platform.

## Pushing Dataframes

```python
import pandasai as pai

df_customers = pai.load("company/customers")

df.push()
```

## Pulling Dataframes

```python

df_customers = pai.pull("company/customers")
```
