## Chat

The `.chat()` method is PandaAI's core feature that enables natural language interaction with your data. It allows you to:
- Query your data using plain English
- Generate visualizations and statistical analyses
- Work with multiple DataFrames simultaneously

For a more UI-based data analysis experience, check out our [Data Platform](/ai-dashboards).

### Basic Usage

```python
import pandasai as pai

df_customers = pai.load("company/customers")

response = df.chat("Which are our top 5 customers?")
```

### Chat with multiple DataFrames

```python
import pandasai as pai

df_customers = pai.load("company/customers")
df_orders = pai.load("company/orders")
df_products = pai.load("company/products")

response = pai.chat('Who are our top 5 customers and what products do they buy most frequently?', df_customers, df_orders, df_products)
```

## Cache

PandasAI uses a cache to store the results of previous queries. The cache is a SQLite database that stores the results of previous queries. This is useful for two reasons:

1. It allows the user to quickly retrieve the results of a query without having to wait for the model to generate a response.
2. It cuts down on the number of API calls made to the model, reducing the cost of using the model.

The cache is stored in a file called `cache.db` in the `/cache` directory of the project. The cache is a SQLite database, and can be viewed using any SQLite client. The file will be created automatically when the first query is made.

### Disabling the cache

The cache can be disabled by setting the `enable_cache` parameter to `False` when creating the `PandasAI` object:

```python

pai.config.set({"enable_cache": False})
```

By default, the cache is enabled.

### Clearing the cache

The cache can be cleared by deleting the `cache.db` file. The file will be recreated automatically when the next query is made. Alternatively, the cache can be cleared by calling the `clear_cache()` method on the `PandasAI` object:

```python
import pandas_ai as pai

pai.clear_cache()
```
