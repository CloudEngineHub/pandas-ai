## What is PandaAI?

PandaAI is a Python library that makes it easy to turn tabular datasets into conversational agents. It consists of a [Data Layer](/v3/data-layer) that handles data processing, transformation and semantic enhancement; and a [Natural Language Layer](/v3/overview-nl) that converts user queries into executable code, including charts generation.

## Who should use PandaAI?

PandaAI is ideal for data professionals who want to analyze data through natural language. Whether you're experienced with SQL and Python or just getting started with data analysis, PandaAI helps you explore and understand your data more efficiently. [Get started](/v3/getting-started).

## How does PandaAI work?

PandaAI uses a combination of a Data Layer and a Natural Language Layer to enable end-to-end data analysis. The open-source library can be used in combination with our [Data Platform](/v3/ai-dashboards). Through the platform, you can push and pull DataFrames to a UI, getting a dataframe-specific AI generated dashboard and conversational agent.
