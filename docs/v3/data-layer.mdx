The Data Layer is built around a powerful [Semantic Layer](/semantic-layer) that handles data processing and representation, enhancing the comprehension of tabular data from various [data sources](/data-ingestion):
- CSV and Excel files
- SQL databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL)
- Cloud data warehouses (BigQuery, Databricks, Snowflake)

This semantic layer processes your data into one of two formats:
- **Materialized DataFrames**: Complete datasets loaded into memory for direct manipulation and analysis
- **Virtualized DataFrames**: Virtual representations of your data that maintain source connections

Both virtualized and materialized dataframes have a `.chat()` method that allows to interact with them using natural language. The dataframes can also be [shared with your team](/share-dataframes) using our [Data Platform](/ai-dashboards).
